# Machine Learning Assignment

## Introduction
This repository contains my submission for the machine learning assignment. The assignment focuses on developing a machine learning model using a dataset of choice, performing data preprocessing, model training, and model evaluation.

## Dataset
For this assignment, I have chosen the Iris dataset, a classic dataset widely used in machine learning. The dataset contains measurements of sepal and petal dimensions of three different species of Iris flowers.

## Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you need the following dependencies:
- Python 
- Jupyter Notebook
- scikit-learn 
- pandas

## Instructions
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Go to the folder containing the contents
3. Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the `.ipynb` file.
4. Follow the instructions provided in the Jupyter Notebook to execute the code and observe the results.
5. Feel free to modify the code, explore different datasets, or try out additional machine learning models.
