    "## Prerequisite 1 ::  Basic Python Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into machine learning, it's important to have a solid understanding of Python programming concepts. Here's a brief explanation of what you should know:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variables: Understanding how to create variables to store data values is fundamental. Variables hold different types of data, such as numbers, strings, or lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Variable assignment\n",
    "   x = 5\n",
    "   name = \"John\"\n",
    "   temperatures = [25.3, 28.6, 24.9]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Types: Familiarity with different data types like integers, floats, strings, booleans, and lists is essential. Knowing how to manipulate and convert between these data types will help in data preprocessing and manipulation tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Different data types\n",
    "   age = 25\n",
    "   height = 1.75\n",
    "   name = \"Alice\"\n",
    "   is_student = True\n",
    "   grades = [90, 85, 95, 88]\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Functions: Understanding how to define and use functions is crucial. Functions encapsulate a piece of reusable code, making your code modular and easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Function definition and usage\n",
    "   def square(num):\n",
    "       return num ** 2\n",
    "\n",
    "   result = square(5)\n",
    "   print(result)  # Output: 25\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Loops: Knowing how to use loops, such as for loops and while loops, is important for repetitive tasks. Loops help iterate over data or perform operations multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # For loop example\n",
    "   numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "   for num in numbers:\n",
    "       print(num)\n",
    "\n",
    "   # While loop example\n",
    "   i = 0\n",
    "   while i < 5:\n",
    "       print(i)\n",
    "       i += 1\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Conditionals: Being familiar with conditional statements (e.g., if, elif, else) allows you to make decisions based on specific conditions. It enables your code to take different paths depending on the situation.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Conditional statement example\n",
    "   age = 20\n",
    "   if age >= 18:\n",
    "       print(\"You are an adult.\")\n",
    "   else:\n",
    "       print(\"You are a minor.\")\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Libraries: Python offers various libraries and modules that extend its functionality. Understanding how to import and utilize libraries, such as Pandas and NumPy, is essential for data manipulation and analysis tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Importing and using libraries\n",
    "   import pandas as pd\n",
    "   import numpy as np\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Example usage\n",
    "   data = pd.read_csv(\"data.csv\")\n",
    "   average = np.mean(data)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a good grasp of these Python programming concepts will provide a solid foundation for working with machine learning algorithms and libraries. It will make it easier to understand the code snippets provided and allow you to customize and adapt them to your specific needs."

    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Manipulation: Pandas provides powerful functions to manipulate data within DataFrames. This includes operations like filtering, sorting, aggregating, merging, and transforming data.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Filtering data\n",
    "   young_people = df[df['Age'] < 30]\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Sorting data\n",

    "\n",
    "   # Aggregating data\n",
    "   average_age = df['Age'].mean()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Preprocessing: Pandas offers various functions to preprocess data, such as handling missing values, dealing with duplicates, scaling data, and encoding categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Handling missing values\n",
    "   df.dropna()  # Drop rows with missing values\n",
    "   df.fillna(0)  # Fill missing values with zeros\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Handling duplicates\n",
    "   df.drop_duplicates()  # Remove duplicate rows\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Scaling data\n",
    "   from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler\n",
    "   scaler = StandardScaler()\n",
    "   scaled_data = scaler.fit_transform(df[['Age', 'Income']])\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Exploration: Pandas provides functions for exploring data, such as summarizing statistics, visualizing data, and handling time series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   # Summarizing statistics\n",
    "   df.describe()  # Descriptive statistics\n",
    "   df['Age'].value_counts()  # Count unique values\n",
